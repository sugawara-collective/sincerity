It’s 18:00. He’s there. Everyday at the same time. That guy named Tooru has the habit of going to the Starbucks where Koushi works.

Moreover, as if that was not enough, day after day he has been leaving him little notes on the napkins. "Thank you for being so kind" and "You always have a smile on your face" were the first ones. Then "Your smile shines on its own", "The mole under your eye is beautiful". Then they became more and more flirty. 

He is too flattered by a person he only knows from making him a Mocha Frappuccino every day and writing on the plastic cup first "Tooru :)" and then "Tooru ♡". He's cute (he has eyes on his face), and the little messages make his day. But what is this boy he sees day in and day out really like? Sugawara has wanted to talk to him, to know something about his life, how he’s like, but he always leaves before he finishes working.

Today, though, that's definitely not going to happen.

Suga has changed his shift so that he can finally meet the famous Tooru. 

<hr/>

“Hello there, sweetie,” Sugawara always speaks this way to customers, using a sweet and calm tone, and having a smile that adorns his face.

But of course, this time it's not just any customer, but the brown-haired one he always sees. The only difference with the rest of the days is that today instead of being the first person he attends, he is the last one he is going to serve a coffee to. For the first time, his work schedule ends with him.

“Hi, Sugawara-chan,” replies Tooru, with a slight blush on his cheeks.

He doesn't even have to tell him his name anymore, Koushi knows what to write on the plastic glass. And, a few minutes later, he places the order in the appropriate area of the bar.

“Enjoy!” And he winks at him, tilting the smile from his lips.

Oikawa's heart is racing as he notices that the gray-haired guy is acting a little differently than other days. What he doesn't know is that he will soon find out why.

Tooru takes his seat where he always does, and pulls his laptop out of his backpack to work on an individual degree project. He is studying Marketing and he’s in his final year, so he likes to get a head start on his homework so that when the time comes he can focus on his Final Degree Project. His idea is to be able to finish the task at hand today and, seeing that the place is calmer than usual, he is aware that he may be able to accomplish his goal.

Or not.

“What is Tooru working on that he is so focused on?”

He thinks it's a dream, that he's hallucinating, but he's not. Across from him has just taken a seat Sugawara, the _gorgeous guy_ who every day puts his coffee on with the best of his smiles and the _gorgeous guy_ in whom he evidently has a rather obvious crush.

"Sugawara-san?", Oikawa finally says once he has been able to come down to Earth. A nervous smile settles on his lips and he is unable to look him in the eye. "I-I'm doing some work. You know, senior year of college and...all that."

Koushi settles a little better in the seat, never taking his sight off the boy at any point.

"I understand you. I'm a senior myself and I have to pull time out from under rocks.", before continuing to speak he lets out a slight sigh. "And I'm getting everything done! But I think one of these days I'm going to end up going completely crazy."

The words spoken by the grey-haired one seem to surprise Tooru quite a bit. But he also feels admiration.

"I didn't know you were doing both things at the same time! That's amazing," the nervous smile he had before disappears for a much firmer one. "So have you finished your shift for today?"

Sugawara nods and smirks.

"How so? Whenever I come over that's when you start."

"I see you're observant, Tooru. Well, that's precisely why! Whenever I finish work I always intend to go and have a little chat with you, but you've already left and all I have are your napkins with little messages on them. I wanted to be able to talk to you for once.” Koushi doesn't know how, but he has been able to blurt it all out. His smile widens and he leans forward a bit to get a better look at who he has in front of him.

Suddenly, Oikawa's cheeks turn pink. Or red. It doesn't matter. But he notices how his face burns.

"I've been wanting to talk to you for a long time, too. But I was afraid to bother you while you were working and then I was beeing late. That's why I was writing you the little notes before I left," the brown-haired one is capable of being completely sincere.

"I see... Well then let's change that, huh? Now that we know we both want to get to know each other better."

"Would you like to meet? With me. Somewhere other than here." As he speaks, Tooru close his computer to put everything away. "I promise we'll have a good time."

"I'd love to.", Sugawara doesn't hesitate in his reply. He grabs a napkin from the table and takes the liberty of borrowing a marker from Oikawa's pencil case. "I hope you'll write to me, okay? Don't be too long."

And he leaves. The Marketing student puts his glasses on properly still somewhat stunned by everything that has just happened. He grabs the napkin on which Suga has written his phone number, next to a "so as not to lose habits. xoxo".

He wants to get home as soon as possible because the sooner he arrives, the sooner he writes to him.

The day of the long-awaited date finally arrives. Sugawara is walking down to the door of the building, where Oikawa is waiting for him. First they are going for a walk and then for dinner. Supposedly, Tooru is going to take him to his favorite eating place. 

"Yo-hoo!", greets the brown-haired, coming up to give him a hug and leave a small kiss on his cheek.

They already have a lot more trust because all this time so far they've been talking through messages. A lot. And they've also seen each other at Starbucks so as not to lose the routine, but there have been no napkins with notes on them. Sugawara has missed them. Anyway, just knowing he was there was enough for him. Now he has to focus on the date.

"Hello, Tooru," he finally greets him back, just as he also kisses him on the chub.

They start walking quietly. They take a rather pleasant walk in a silence not at all uncomfortable. Everything is going very well. From time to time they chat about anything that comes to their mind. They laugh. They enjoy it. They enjoy _themselves_.

"We're already here. It's a pizza place, I hope you like it," Oikawa puts his hand to the back of his neck, letting out a nervous little laugh. "Maybe it's too basic, but I've been coming here since I was little and I have very fond memories."

"It's perfect, and I love pizza. Thank you for sharing this place with me," the warmth rising in Sugawara's chest grows larger as the seconds pass. It's somewhat a new feeling for him, but he likes it. He likes how Tooru makes him feel.

They are already seated and have already ordered. The waiter brings an appetizer consisting of a bowl of olives. Suga lets out a small laugh and shakes his head as he pushes it away and, at the same time, pulls it closer towards Oikawa.

"You don't like olives?", the brown-haired asks pretending to be offended, to which Koushi ends up saying no with a nod. "Well, it's actually better. You know the theory of How I Met Your Mother? The one about Marshall and Lily."

"Not really, I don't. What is it about?"

"I'll tell you someday," and, winking seductively, he pops an olive into his mouth.

Sugawara has lied to him. He does remember the theory told in the series and what it entails. But he would have liked Tooru to explain it to him. In any case, he is still excited that he alluded to it. It tells that Oikawa thinks they make a good couple.

Dinner goes well. After eating a pizza and a tiramisu between the two of them, they ask for the bill. And Tooru insists several times to invite him, but Koushi refuses. He takes the opportunity to tell him that, if he wants to pay, they should have another date and that there he might think about whether to let him do it or not. 

They go to Sugawara's apartment, taking the opportunity to take another walk and enjoy the time they have left together. What they didn't expect was that it was starting to rain so suddenly. It begins to sprinkle, but it doesn't take long for the rain to come down hard. For that reason, they speed up their pace quite a bit and get under the buildings they can.

"I can't believe it!" protests Oikawa, gripping Koushi's hand tightly so as not to separate at any time.

"Don't worry, Tooru. You can come up to my apartment and I'll leave you an umbrella or something," the gray-haired replies, raising his voice a little so he could hear him without any trouble.

After the run to Sugawara's house, they both go to the bathroom to try to dry off a bit with the hairdryer. It is a failed attempt since they are still soaked.

"Come to my room, I can leave you some spare clothes and you can return them to me. I think they will fit you," Sugawara tells him as an alternative, starting to walk towards the mentioned place. "And don't even think of contradicting me, I don't want you to catch pneumonia."

"Whatever you say, captain!" is all he can reply, amid laughter.

Koushi lets him change in his room while he goes to the bathroom, and when he returns, he finds Oikawa watching everything around him. He's found himself the less gossipy love interest, all right. He crosses his arms and raises an eyebrow, waiting for him to notice.

"Sorry! It's just... I was curious about your room. I didn't know you played guitar." In an attempt to change the subject, he points to the instrument. "Would you give me a demonstration?"

"Oikawa, it's twelve o'clock at night. Maybe the neighbors will kill me... But okay, fine. I'll play a little but I'll keep it low.” It's hard for him to say no to Tooru.

He carefully unsheathes his precious instrument and sits down on the bed, nodding to the brown-haired to do the same. After checking that it is indeed in tune, he gets into position to play.

"I hope you've seen _Camp Rock 2_, because if you haven't you know what we're going to do on the second date," Sugawara warns him before he starts playing the first chords of _Introducing Me_. He also starts singing when the song calls for it, leaving Oikawa completely spellbound.

It's as if he's singing the song to him, mostly because Koushi feels just like Nick Jonas when he sings it; he wants to do everything he can to make Tooru really get to know him well so he can like him that way. What he doesn't know is that he's more than succeeding.

"You're an angel, really."

"Oikawa!" Suga can't manage to say anything else, mostly because he's blushing like a tomato and would get tongue-tied if he tried to utter any more words.

The aforementioned doesn't take long to approach him with all the gentleness in the world to finally take the guitar from him with great care, leaving it on the bed. His hands cradle the other's face and he caresses it, telling him with gestures what is the next move he has in mind to make. Sugawara does not refuse at all. For that very reason, they end up pressing their lips in a kiss that gives the perfect finishing touch to the best first date they have ever had in their lives.

<hr/>

Sugawara can't stop thinking about the date he and Oikawa had over the weekend. That makes him a little more dispersed at work and he serves orders a little slower than at other times. The customers don't notice this change of pace, but Koushi himself does and he feels pretty bad. But he can't help thinking about him, he is beyond his strength. And when he sees him walk through the door, his heart starts beating very fast. That's all he needed.

When it's finally his turn, a small smile comes to the brown-haired's lips. He even leans down to give him a little kiss on the tip of his nose.

"Hey, Kou, can I have my usual?"

"Yeah, sure. On my way,” he says almost breathlessly, leaving to prepare it skillfully.

The plastic cup with "Tooru ♡" written on it is placed on top of the bar where the ready orders are left. Suga smiles rather broadly and gets a little bigger when Oikawa picks up his coffee. 

"Will you stay until my shift is over today?"

"I don't think so... I have to leave around seven to do some blissful group work." He sighs, grimacing in disgust. "Tomorrow I'll really wait for you, okay?"

And Koushi nods, giving his one last smirk that grants his permission to go sit at the table he sits at every day.

The evening passes quietly, with not too many customers but not too few either. At seven o'clock, as he has indicated, Tooru leaves, but not before approaching Sugawara to kiss him on the cheek as a farewell. He definitely is in love with him.

The clock strikes a quarter to ten at night. He takes advantage of the fact that no one is there to clean up the place with his workmate Tendou. While he cleans the bar and the area where the drinks are prepared, the red-haired is cleaning and clearing the tables. Because of their smartness, they always clean little by little throughout the workday, so thanks to that it doesn't take them long to finish leaving the place spotless.

"Hey, Suga, I think this napkin is for you." Tendou catches his eye as he realizes that the gray-haired one is about to leave — today it's his partner's turn to close.

He grabs the piece of paper to read what it says knowing that Oikawa is the person who left it for him, who else would it be? Her eyes widen like saucers, is he really asking him _that_ like this?

"_Do you want to be my boyfriend?_" is what it says on the napkin. 

Ready to rush out of the room to call him on the phone, a body in front of the door stops him. He bumps into someone and is about to complain, but is silenced when he realizes that it is Tooru. And it's not just the brown-haired. It's him and a bunch of flowers. Sunflowers, to be exact. His favorite flower.

"Did you read the message?" is the first thing Oikawa says to him as a way of greeting, cocking a slightly nervous smile.

"Yes."

"So... What do you say?"

"I just told you. Yes."

After the answer Koushi gives, Tooru ends up taking him in his arms so that they can press their lips in a kiss. Thus closes a circle that has no return. A circle that began with a message on a napkin, and that has ended the same way. 

Thanks to a piece of paper and some cups that have always written on them the name of the brown-haired, Sugawara Koushi and Oikawa Tooru have really known each other. They have fallen in love with each other. And they are going to enjoy each other forever.
