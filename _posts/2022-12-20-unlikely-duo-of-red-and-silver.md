This was just great! Suga thought, sighing, as he swung around the city. Not only was he going to miss his english test, which he was pretty sure he wouldn’t be able to make up, but now the criminal was getting away. He wasted too much time talking to the guy, in hopes he would come to his senses. When do the villain-types ever come to their senses? Sugawara was so annoyed, sometimes this superhero thing was the worst, but he still wouldn’t change being Spider-Man for the world. He has a responsibility to help those in need, and he wasn’t about to stop that now, even for one test. Maybe he should though, he thought letting out a groan. He’ll just explain the bad grade to his uncle later.

The criminal seemed to be 3 blocks away from his current position, so if he swung from the next apartment closest to him, he should have enough momentum to take down the criminal. His spidey senses also seem confirming this, however they also seemed to be going off about something else. Something above him; Sugawara turned his head away from the building ahead of him, and instead to the clouds above him. What the hell? He was confused. Before he had time to process the sign something huge fell on top of him, tackling him to the ground.

“Owww” He screamed out loud, looking at the thing, or better yet the person who landed on top of him. 

“Wow buggy boy you're not as good at this web slinging thing as everyone gives you credit for” The masked man smirked.

Oh great I have a real comedian on my hands, Sugawara thought looking at the red suited man. He had a matching katana blade, holsters through which Sugawara could not make out the guns, and black spots around his mask's eye holes. How clever Sugawara sighed, rolling his eyes. But he could’ve sworn he's seen this guy before? Or at least has heard of him.

“You mind getting off of me,” Sugawara growled.

“Oh my bad Spidey!” Tendou got up handing, him a hand. Hahah I’m really clever for that one Tendou thought looking down at the bug boy below him.

Sugawara begrudgingly grabbed his hand. “Mind telling me well you fell on top of me?”

“Oh well I was actually hired to ya know…” Tendou stopped, not sure whether he could say that word for a general audience. “You know unalive someone! To save the world, and all that hero stuff you know.”

Sugawara rolled his eyes. He really didn’t know what he meant by that.

“Sadly my contact didn’t tell me what this heinous criminal looked like, or what they are called. Just that they would be in this area, at approximately, he began looking at his wrist watch, THIS TIME!” He said looking up, and smirking at Spider-Man.

“However there doesn’t seem to be anyone else here but you, Spidey. So unfortunately I have to take you out! You know, being a mercenary and all, but it’s not personal! I’m actually a big fan!”

Sugawara had to be imagining things! No way this guy just fell out of the sky and landed on him, and was hired to kill someone, and that just so happened to be him? Wait didn’t he say he was a mercenary? Mercenary in a red suit? Wait, don't tell me this dude is… “Deadpool?” Sugawara asked, looking up at him.

“No! DON’T TELL ME! YOU'RE A DEADPOOL FAN!” Tendou began screaming.

Sugawara took back everything he had ever said. Superheoring was truly the worst! Sugawara had only heard rumors of Deadpool from other heroes, but from what he had heard he was nothing but trouble. He was given the nickname Merc With a Mouth, and he sure knew how to run it Sugawara was realizing. He wasn’t necessarily a bad guy, and occasionally he actually helped out fellow heroes. He was a mercenary though, which meant he followed where the money meant. The money was unfortunately pointing at Sugawara. How surprising he thought rolling his eyes, You mean half of Tokyo didn’t want his head on a silver platter?

However, what didn’t make sense was that Deadpool had said his contact had not told him what his target looked like or their name? So how did he know it was Spider-Man! Why on earth would he think he thinks it’s Spider-Man when he was the one who fell on him! They didn’t run into each other because they were supposed to. Deadpool literally fell out of the sky and landed on him! 

This was definitely some kind of mistake, Sugawara thought. He had to put a stop to this now, before things turned violent! He still had an actual criminal on the loose on top of it, so he needed to get out of this situation as soon as possible.

“Listen, as fun as it's been chatting, I really need to get going! So please get out of the way” Sugawara said, beginning to walk in front of Deadpool. 

“I’m sorry Spidey! It is nothing personal but I can’t let you leave. I never fail my mission, and right now that mission is taking you out” Tendou said, putting his hand out in front of Spider-Man..

“I won’t ask you again Deadpool, move” Sugawara said looking up at the red and black mask. Normally he was pretty good at reading people’s emotions even through a mask, but he couldn't see anything in Deadpool’s eyes. He had a deadpan, void of emotional expression and it horrified Sugawara. He had a feeling he wasn’t kidding about taking him out. 

Sugawara could feel the hairs on the back of his neck sticking up. That was his spider sense tingling, which could only mean one thing; Sugawara could feel that a katana was about to be swung at him, so he dodged it as Tendou was mid swing, and stuck to the closest wall next to him for protection. Great! His was going to be a full out brawl, Sugawara noted as his webbing wrapped around the red suited man. 

“Wow! I’m actually in a real battle with Spider-Man! What are the odds!” Tendou giggled, chopping off the webs with his katana. “Sadly this battle isn’t going to be in your favor” He smirked at spidey. 

“If you are such a big fan of mine, then why do you insist on killing me!” Sugawara said, continuing to dodge his attacks.

“I told you, Spidey, it’s not personal, but it’s about to be if you don't get down from there!” Tendou yelled, throwing his sword to where the spider was perched on the wall. Sugawara quickly dodged the sword and swung to the other side. 

“Hey, that could’ve taken off my head!” Sugawara yelled.

“That was the point!” Tendou huffed, as he retrieved his katana. 

Perfect! He’s distracted, Sugawara thought as flipped off the wall and threw webs around Deadpool again. “You already said your contact didn’t give you a name! So you have no idea if I’m really your target. So now you're recentlessly attacking your favorite hero even though you don't 100% know if I’m your target! That sounds like a bad way to do business practices if you ask me, '' Sugawara said, webbing his mouth shut. 

Good that should be me some time Sugawara thought, swinging away. He had to create some space between him and Deadpool, and even more important; he had to figure out where this criminal had run away too. Sugawara webbed himself to the building he was supposed to find the criminal at. He couldn’t have gotten this far, he thought.

“Use to be your favorite hero,” Tendou grumbled through the webs. Now it’s the trippy doctor strange guy for sure, he thought, rolling his eyes. He ripped through webs and started heading towards the webhead. That stupid spider couldn’t have gotten that far.

“There you are!”

Sugawara once again swung towards the criminal to apprehend him, only to be crushed by a mysterious person from the sky. Except it wasn’t a mystery at all! Sugawara had now had it up to here with this guy. He pushed Deadpool off him and slammed him into the ground. “Deadpool this has to stop! I’m not your enemy! Sugawara shouted at him. 

“Sorry Spidey but that’s no longer an option” Tendou said, placing a gun to his head.

“Wow you too really are gullible” A figure rose above them.

“I expected that from the spider, but you Deadpool, aren’t you supposed to be better than that? The world’s most famous mercenary couldn’t even kill Spider-Man? Well serves me right for hiring and idiot”

“What did you just say?” Tendou said, lowering his weapon, staring at the man in front of them.

“Oh nothing, just for a mercenary to hire, you’re pretty shit! But you know what they say you want something done right you have to do it yourself” He said placing an explosive in front of them.

“Shit.”

“Deadpool, look out,” Sugawara said, swinging them away from the explosion. 

Sugwara sighed in relief, that it was too close! “Alright so do you believe me now when I say I’m not your enemy”

Tendou just had his face hunched down, upset with himself, as he looked up at the man in the gray and black suit.

“Alright okay, so maybe you were right! Can we go get that guy now? And kill him?


“Yes,” Sugawara said, relieved that they were now on the same page. Wait kill him! No! He thought looking down at Wade; only to find that he was no longer there, but now after the criminal.

“Deadpool, get back here!” Sugawara yelled, swinging over to him.

“Well I will say that was a clever little trick of you trying to get me to kill Spider-Man, but not clever enough” Tendou called out reloading his gun. He pulled the trigger before the other man had time to react. The bullet landed right in his shin, and he went tumbling to the ground.

The man began sighing heavily avoiding the urge to scream. He didn’t have any more explosives on him, and he was well aware he was cornered. “It must've been fun messing with me but playtime is over '' Tendou said, pointing the gun at his head.

“Deadpool, stop,” Sugawara yelled, standing in front of the injured criminal. “Listen I know you think you have every right to kill him, but that wouldn’t make us any different from the criminals. Please let him go and I will turn him in to the authorities.”

“Oh all of you goody two-shoes heroes are the same. You think he will stop just because he is behind bars? There is only one way to end this” He said the gun still aimed for his head. “And now it's personal since he came after my business”.

“Please, Deadpool, I saved your life! Please let me take him away.” Sugawara once again looked for an expression behind his eyes and found none; that only left him with another choice. “Please,” he said, slowly pulling off his mask. His gray curls framing his face as sweat dripped down his forehead.

He was even more pretty than Tendou could have imagined. He sighed, lowering his weapon. “Alright but only just this one time cause you saved my life! AND I'M YOUR BIGGEST FAN! What's your real name by the way!”

Sugawara just sighed, putting back on his mask as he faced the criminal. “Alright you’ve caused enough trouble for one day! To the authorities we go,” he said, swinging them away.

“See you later Spider-Man! Till we meet again, love,” Tendou smiled.

Sugawara just rolled his eyes. He guessed the Merc With a Mouth wasn’t so bad after all.
