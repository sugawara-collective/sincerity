a flourish of crimson acacia delicately breathes<br/>
in fogs and plumes of rising kudzu up, up, skywards,<br/>
and he holds a golden ranunculus in the palms of his hands.

in the sweetened sakura petal breeze,<br/>
through silent whispers of white clover, <br/>
a flourish of crimson acacia delicately breathes.

a grape hyacinth soul yearns for fresh air<br/>
he could not reach a marigold’s desire that was not his own. he sighs<br/>
and he holds a golden ranunculus in the palms of his hands.

blooms of orange and blossoms of white rose<br/>
guide a nemophila heart to victory.<br/>
a flourish of crimson acacia delicately breathes.

plains of poppy to slumber a dream<br/>
death is a daffodil<br/>
and he holds a golden ranunculus in the palms of his hands.

teaching the peony’s honor to spring sprigs<br/>
the petals fall on wildflower’s dreams’ pavement and <br/>
a flourish of crimson acacia delicately breathes.

zinnia memories<br/>
purple iris words<br/>
and a golden ranunculus in the palms of his hands.

sugawara koushi-<br/>
a garden and a gardener all the same.<br/>
a flourish of crimson acacia delicately breathes<br/>
and he holds a golden ranunculus in the palms of his hands.
