The following will contain crochet charts for the various parts that are combined to make the Corner-to-Corner Granny Square Cardigan featuring a Doggie Patch (to honor the lovely Sugawara and his dog socks). 

I will include the color sketch for the construction of the cardigan I made, which uses 5x5 and 7x7 patches. Following the exact sketch and dimensions will result in a XS/S cardigan. To make it larger, you can work with larger squares or more squares. That’s the great thing about granny square garments—you can just make however many to fit into the pattern you need and sew them together.


## CONSTRUCTION

Within the dog patch, I used the colors: black, light brown, and cream. For the solid squares, I used the colors: charcoal, gray, dark brown, light brown, tan, and cream. Cream was also used for all the ribbing. There were 25 solid 5x5 squares of various colors (shown in sketch), 2 doggie patches, and 12 7x7 squares. For the yarn, I chose generic Red Heart Super Saver acrylic yarn (medium weight), and I used a 5mm hook.

Around each square (as well as the ears), I included single crochet border. This is optional. I added the ribbing after sewing the main portion of the cardigan together. You may create the ribbing separately and sew it on later or attach it directly. Remember, you will be decreasing a lot from the sleave to the cuff ribbing to get that puffed sleeve look, so plan that math beforehand!

## RESIZING

For making larger doggie patches, I have included some pixel art of how you might construct a 7x7. Think of each pixel as one of the clusters of double crochet. The 5x5 pixel art is included for reference on how this translated into the pattern provided.

To make larger (or smaller) ears, sketch out the shape you would like and use single crochets and decreasing rows to make the shape. (Seriously, this is how I just crochet things all the time. I just sketch out shapes, maybe google the stitch I am thinking, then just freehand it. Chaos meets some sort of crochet geometry.)

## CROCHET PATTERN

<span style="float: left;display:inline;">Below are crochet pattern charts for the various elements of the cardigan. I have included a key so you can follow along. When doing the decreases of the dog ears, I recommend varying where they happen to make the ear as straight as possible. When I decreased, I did so in the two in the center, then the two on the left, and lastly into the rightmost stich (not combining it with another).</span>

Bonus: I am terrible at documenting, but other people on the internet are not. So I am going to link the construction pattern for a [granny square cardigan (includes video)](https://hayhaycrochet.com/crochet-patterns/cardigans/crochet-cozy-granny-square-cardigan/) and a [video tutorial on the corner-to-corner granny square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4-6dBxkL8Q).
