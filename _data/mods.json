    "thought": "there is a lot of beauty in an 'average' character who is able to break through those insecurities to become the best person they can be despite it all! he shows me the healthiest self i can be :') also he is insane",

    "thought": "suga is such a pivotal character in the series. though often sidelined, he always makes everything count. he does his best by being the best support, showing me that you don’t need to be a genius to be able to make a mark. all you have to be is sincere and kind and passionate about what you do, and you will be happy!!",
