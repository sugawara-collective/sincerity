- question: I haven't submitted to a zine before and wanted to ask what the pitches submission is? I wanted to submit a poem but didn't know if the "pitches submission" means I would need to write a different poem then what I plan to submit? Hopefully that makes sense! Thank you!

  answer: Hi! For our zine, we'll be giving a lot of freedom to the contributors. Pitches are basically what you're interested in doing for your piece. For example, "character study on Suga's path to becoming a teacher" or "Suga and Akaashi going shopping together" or "daisuga smooching on the beach". It's mostly for us to get a general sense of what people are interested in submitting. We may guide people who want to submit multiple pitches just for better distribution of ship/gen content for the zine, but if you already had a specific idea in mind for your piece, you could just submit that pitch, and you'd be good to go! We'll also be pretty relaxed about pitches, so contributors are free to change up their submission anytime, and you won't be locked into your pitch if it doesn't work out!
