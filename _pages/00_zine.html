<p>We are proud to announce the first look at the amazing works of the Sugawara Anthology! Our contributors have created over 40 works, ranging from illustrations to fanfictions to nendo shoots and so much more. We invite you are all look through the content on our website during this holiday season. (Sugawara is a present for everyone!)</p>

<p>A digital version of the zine including digital merch (and possibly a few more surprises!) is now available!. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/SugawaraZine" target="_blank">Follow this link to save it for yourself.</p>

<p>On February 22, 2023, the webzine will no longer be available for viewing as our contributers will be sharing their works on their socials, but we will keep the link for the digital zine available here.</p>
